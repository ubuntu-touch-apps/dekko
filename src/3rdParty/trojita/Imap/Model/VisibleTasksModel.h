/** @short Proxy model showing a list of tasks that are active or pending

In contrast to the full tree model, this proxy will show only those ImapTasks that somehow correspond to an activity requested by
user.  This means that auxiliary tasks like GetAnyConnectionTask, KeepMailboxOpenTask etc are not shown.

The goal is to have a way of showing an activity indication whenever the IMAP connection is "doing something".
