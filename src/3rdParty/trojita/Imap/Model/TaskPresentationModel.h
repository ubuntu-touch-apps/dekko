This class provides a standard Qt model which provides a tree hierarchy of all tasks which are somehow registered with its parent
model.  The tasks are organized in a tree with active tasks being all children of the root item.  Tasks which are waiting for
completion of another task are positioned as children of the item they're blocking at.
