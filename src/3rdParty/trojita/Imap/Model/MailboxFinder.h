/** @short Find model indexes for mailboxes

The API of the Model doesn't currently have a way of asking for a QModelIndex for a named mailbox.
This class fills that gap.

To start, call the addMailbox() method for each mailbox that you want to look up. Then, after
several invocations of the event loop, the IMAP server will be asked for incremental mailbox
listing, nesting as needed. When the mailbox is found, the mailboxFound() slot will fire.

When there's a problem finding that mailbox, no signal will be emitted. This is related to how the
Model currently works, because the Tasks have no way of informing the user that they failed.

In addition, the MailboxFinder works purely on MVC layer, so it has no IMAP knowledge besides custom
item roles.
