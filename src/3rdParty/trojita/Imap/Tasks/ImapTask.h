/** @short Parent class for all IMAP-related jobs

Each ImapTask serves a distinct purpose; some of them are for establishing a connection to the IMAP server, others are responsible
for updating FLAGS of some messages, other tasks maintain a given mailbox synchronized with the server's responses and yet others
deal with listing mailboxes, to name a few examples.

Each task signals its successful completion by the completed() signal.  Should the activity fail, failed() is emitted.

Some tasks perform activity which could be interrupted by the user without huge trouble, for example when downloading huge
attachments.  Tasks which support this graceful abort shall do so when asked through the abort() method.

Sometimes a task will have to deal with the fact that it is forbidden to use the network connection anymore.  That's what the
die() command is for.
